# PopularityPrediction
In the web-app, when user selects a particular  music artist, he can see that artists image. On clicking on it, that artist’s top 10, most  popular songs are displayed which are predicted using Machine learning algorithms. The  top 10 song’s 30 second preview can also be played in the web-app. Also, user can see  similar artists to that of the selected artists. Various data visualizations can be done  pertaining to similar artists. All the data that is used for this project comes from a API,  which provides Spotify’s live music data. Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video  service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over  the world.
